                <h2>About me</h2>

                <p> My name is Azamat Yessimov, I am 21 years old. Excited to be at the start phase of my career as
                    a
                    web developer. I almost got a bachelor's degree in transportation technology however, I see my
                    career in development in the future.
                    I think I have basic skills. I am keen on to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I
                    am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among its developers. In
                    return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.
                    I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front-end developer.</p>
